# Health Risk Prediction Project

## Overview

This project predicts the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) based on patient demographic, lifestyle, and medical data. The dataset used for this project is the Framingham Heart Study dataset, which contains various health and risk factors.

## Key Steps

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigated relationships between health factors and CHD risk.
- **Modeling**: Trained a Gradient Boosting model, achieving an accuracy of XX%.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance with classification reports and confusion matrices.

## Conclusion

The model provides a reliable prediction of heart disease risk, which can be used to assist in early diagnosis and preventive measures.
